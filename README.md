# Eternals

Eternals is a fictional yoga retreat school (imagined by me) for which I built a website. 
In this project I tried to use all of my knowledge to create a decent fully responsive design website. White space is use that way on purpose, so it can fit the atmosphere of peace and reflect the message of the 'business' better. For the purpose of the website, I made a small timer in JS, and an animation in CSS that represents a breathing exercise.  

Technologies used: HMTL5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery.
